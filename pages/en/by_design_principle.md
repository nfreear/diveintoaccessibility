## Browse tips by design principle

Here the tips are grouped by design principles proposed by the <abbr title="World Wide Web Consortium">W3C</abbr>. Your weblog should be:

1. __Perceivable__. You should ensure that all content can be presented in forms that can be perceived by everyone.
2. __Operable__. You should ensure that the interface elements in the content are operable by everyone.
3. __Navigable__. You should facilitate content orientation and navigation.
4. __Understandable__. You should make it as easy as possible for people to understand your content and controls.
5. __Robust__. You should use technologies that maximize the ability of your content to work with current and future web browsers, assistive technologies, and other programs.
